# wii-scripts

This is a collection of a handful of useful Wii scripts I've either written or converted from some other language. These probably won't have much in terms of usage directions, so you may need to do a little trial and error. Some of these are libWiiPy based, and some are not. If they are, you'll probably need the latest version of libWiipy from git as listed in `requirements.txt`.

Some of these are copied from the `scripts/` directory from WiiPy, as my goal is to eventually move the random scripts out of that repository.
